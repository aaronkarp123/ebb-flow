<i>With, and again</i> is an exploration of sociality through sound, sight, and time. Based on an algorithm that describes
bird flocking patterns, this work bends the rules of interaction to continuously create new modes of behavior. This creation,
sometimes sudden and other times gradual, is reflected in the modulation of a representative soundscape. The audience is 
observer and disruptor as they exist inside of a generative process of building and breaking social connections.
